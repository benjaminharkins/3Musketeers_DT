Project Title: Popular Sports in Countries around the Globe

Team members: 
Michael High, Benjamin Harkins, Prasanna Vanguri

Project Description:
In this project we are looking to correlate popular sports per 
country as well as which country is the most popular in overall 
sports' sales. We will then compare them and plot.

Research Questions:
1) which country sells more online tickets?
	a) which country has more sales (per sport)?
2) which sporting events are popular per country?
3) what sports are the most popular in a given region?
4) what time of year is the best for sports?
5) what season is the best for each sport?
6) which country has the highest ticket prices per sport?

Datasets to be used:
venue
sporting events
sporting events per region/country

ticket sales (will need to perform currency exchange)
seasonal popularity for each sport
ticket costs/prices
